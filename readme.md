# Debuggable Svelte Chrome Extension

A minimal Svelte Chrome extension boilerplate that's preconfigured for debugging with source maps.

## Directions

To start debugging, set you breakpoints and then run:

```
npm install
npm watch
```

Go to the VSCode Run view

Make sure Launch Chrome is seleteced from the dropdown menu 

Click the play button

A new Chrome instance should launch with your plugin installed and DevTools should automatically open

At that point, you can debug like you would any other app.
